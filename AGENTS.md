# AGENTS.md

DeepSeek Harness is an all-plugin Cordis agent harness. Read [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) before changing `packages/`; [docs/AGENTS.md](docs/AGENTS.md) governs documentation.

## Pre-stable APIs and released Session data

Public APIs are pre-stable; update every consumer. Released Session JSONL follows [adjacent migration](.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-08-31-released-session-format-migrations.md): reads may add a version-named successor but never move, overwrite, or delete committed generations; predecessors get neither fallback nor downgrade. SQLite domains use monotonic `SCHEMA_VERSION`.

**Application launch.** Only `dsh` profiles launch supported Node apps; package bins, demos, and public SDK argv escapes are forbidden ([rule](docs/architecture.md#application-launch)).

### Host sandbox failures

If a required `gh`, `pnpm`, build, test, or generator command fails because the sandbox blocks credentials, network, IPC, watching, or nested `sandbox-exec`, retry unchanged with the narrowest host escalation — with sandbox evidence; never bypass test failures or the product sandbox.

### Run relevant checks locally

Run checks before pushes via [dsh-pre-push-checks](.agents/skills/dsh-pre-push-checks/SKILL.md); report only commands run; validate immediately after `gh stack sync` and never merge before checks pass.

- Match evidence to the surface: focused behavior tests, model/user-output snapshots, `doc-sync` for docs, built smokes for published paths, and real-API e2e for providers.
- Never default to the full suite or repeat a passing check for commit or push: CI owns exhaustive coverage and the platform matrix; rehearse all locally only on explicit request, for CI diagnosis, or repository-wide.
- `test:coverage`, not `test`, is the CI coverage gate ([why](docs/testing.md)).

## Secrets / .env

Real-API tests and demos read `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, optional `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL`, and root `.env`; never commit credentials — CI e2e skips without a key ([testing.md](docs/testing.md) owns key policy). cordis.yml allows `!!js` (never `!js`) under plugin `config` and entry `disabled`; other metadata stays literal; conditional composition uses overlays ([primer](docs/cordis-primer.md#loader-configuration)).

## Conventions

- Every npm package is `@deepseek-ai/dsh-<name>`; vendored packages are rescoped ([mapping](docs/rescope.md)) and `private: true`. `@deepseek-ai/cordis` is a peerDependency (+ dev) of every harness package.
- ESM everywhere (`"type": "module"`); use package names across packages, `.ts` in local relative imports. Config subprocesses run built `lib/` under plain Node; source regressions use their declared launcher ([testing policy](docs/testing.md#test-subprocess-launch-modes)). The `dsh` CLI source launch runs through tsx's ESM-only hook (`node --import tsx/esm`), so reached modules must stay ESM (no CJS-only exports; Node's native TypeScript modes are unavailable in the supported engines, [source-launch contract](.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-07-29-dsh-source-launch-tsx-esm.md)). Raw/Web `cordis.yml` bare plugins must appear in their resolver manifest's `dependencies` (`verify-cordis-config` enforces).
- **Registrations are effects**: every contribution goes through `ctx.effect()` / `ctx.on()`; a registry's `register()` returns the disposer.
- **Runtime invariants assert owned relationships.** Publish `./invariant` only when independent observations can diverge; otherwise omit it and record why in its README. Empty installers and presence, metadata, effects, or fixed-example checks are invalid ([package invariant rules](packages/AGENTS.md)).
- **Typed events use declaration merging** with merge-extensible maps. Event and service JSDoc needs `@mode` and payload `@param` (service methods document parameters and non-void returns); scoped keys absent from payloads need `@dshScopeScan unsupported`. `SessionEventMap` members are required-on-read by default — unknown types refuse the log without `ignorable: true`; only structural format changes bump `SESSION_FORMAT_VERSION` ([mechanism](.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-08-10-session-log-version-mechanism.md)).
- **Switch on discriminant tags.** Closed unions end in `assertNever`; merge-extensible unions fall through a documented default.
- **Waterfall listeners MUST call `next()`** to delegate; returning without it short-circuits the chain ([semantics](docs/cordis-primer.md#cordis-waterfall-semantics)).
- **Model-visible ⟺ logged**: anything that reaches a model request must be reconstructable from the session log; a new model-visible input requires a session event.
- **Plugins, not loop changes**: new behavior goes on documented extension points; changing `agent-loop` requires updating docs/architecture.md.
- **A capability seam comprises Service Definition / Service Provider / Consumer roles.** It is complete, never one role; split only when roles evolve independently ([glossary](docs/glossary.md#capability-seam)).
- **Prefer maintained dependencies over hand-rolling** when they genuinely delete owned code and tests ([policy](.agents/notes/implemented/process/2026-07-26-dependencies-over-hand-rolling.md)).
- **Explicit > implicit at package boundaries**: defaulting is an explicit `resolve(request): Spec` step in the owning implementation, never a hidden `?? default` inside `run()` (see `dsh-shell`).
- **No hardcoded tunables in plugins**: deployment-varying choices are validated `Config` fields changeable from cordis.yml; a `DEFAULT_*` constant or test hook is not configurability; protocol constants, external specs, and security invariants stay fixed.
- **Misconfiguration fails loud** at load when self-contained, otherwise at the earliest resolvable point; never silently skip a missing referent.
- **Opaque cross-boundary ids are branded** (`Branded<B>` from `dsh-brand`), never bare `string`.
- **Trust TypeScript at typed same-process boundaries.** Do not add runtime validation, fallback behavior, or hostile-input tests solely for values the static interface requires; validate at parser/config, queued, model/tool JSON, durable/file, worker, process, and wire boundaries.
- **Source plane vs artifact plane, never mixed.** Static gates and tests resolve imports through tsconfig `paths` to `src` on a clean tree; gates consuming built `lib/` declare that dependency ([layout](docs/development.md#typescript-project-layout)).
- **Keep compiler faces explicit.** Packages with Host and Client programs expose face-specific leaf configs and a solution-only root; repo-wide programs seed a face config, never the root solution ([layout](docs/development.md#typescript-project-layout)).
- **An empty `catch` names what it swallows** and why nothing else can reach it; keep `try` to one statement.
- **Keep comments local.** Do not restate code, explain distant behavior unless locally required, or expand unrelated comments ([rationale](.agents/notes/implemented/process/2026-08-09-concrete-prose-names-actors-and-recorded-facts.md)).
- **Prefer symmetry for parallel values**; unexplained asymmetry usually signals a missed extraction.
- **Tests describe behavior, not correctness.** Change obsolete behavior with its tests; explain why in the PR.
- **Non-trivial changes MUST include an Agent Note in the same PR;** mechanical/local edits are exempt ([scope](.agents/notes/README.md#when-to-write-one)). Archived notes are frozen — never edit or treat them as current authority ([archive policy](.agents/notes/README.md#archiving-and-deletion)).
- **Client UI copy is locale-owned.** Route product text through typed dictionaries and `t` or localized primitive props; `verify-client-ui-i18n` rejects hardcoded copy ([decision](.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-08-23-locale-owned-client-ui-copy.md)).
- **Testing policy** — [docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md). Every non-trivial model- or user-visible change updates a keyless recorded-session snapshot; [snapshot ownership](snapshots/AGENTS.md) reserves the top level for session-driven cases; other expected output stays owner-local. Fixtures replay on macOS/Linux; fix fixtures, not normalizers.
- **Design each tool's UI presentation up front.** Host presenters stay pure; Web cards derive from raw events and persisted result metadata ([cookbook](docs/cookbook/adding-a-tool.md)).
- **Plan unit, e2e, and snapshot coverage** for capability seams, lifecycle paths, and transcript output; include missing snapshot-harness support in the same change.
- **Both SDKs project the loop.** Agent-loop, session-lifecycle, and `SessionEventMap` changes update the TypeScript and Python SDK expected outputs in the same PR; `pnpm run test` covers neither ([surfaces](docs/testing.md#when-a-snapshot-test-is-required)).
- **Choose PR history deliberately.** Split independent changes and fix the introducing PR before propagation. Rewrites use `--force-with-lease` (never raw `--force`), abort on remote movement, and keep a merge-forward checkpoint before taking a newer base ([rationale](.agents/notes/implemented/process/2026-08-02-native-github-stacks-and-optional-rebases.md)).
- **Labels:** one PR `kind/*`, all material `area/*`, and native Issue Type ([taxonomy](.agents/notes/implemented/process/2026-08-08-unified-github-label-taxonomy.md)).
- TODO markers: `FIXME`/`TODO`/`XXX` by urgency ([semantics](docs/development.md)).
- Files end with exactly one trailing newline; `git diff --cached --check` (pre-commit) gates it.

- Read [docs/defensive-patterns.md](docs/defensive-patterns.md) before lifecycle, concurrency, subprocess, or teardown work.

## Type safety and documentation

Everything compiles under `strict: true` with `noImplicitAny`; every remaining `any` explains why narrowing is infeasible. Every module and export has concise JSDoc for its non-obvious contract; function-like exports include `@param`/`@returns` (`verify-export-jsdoc` enforces). Heritage members, plugin-protocol slots, and constructors keep docs at the declaring Service Definition, protocol, or class.

Comments and docs state complete contracts and context in direct concrete terms — no reasoning transcripts, metaphors, control-flow narration, review history, or restated code. Prefer a more exact term over `contract`, `boundary`, or `shape`; reserve `contract` for obligations callers and implementers rely on (preconditions, postconditions, invariants, compatibility promises) and keep a literal process, wire, security, transaction, or lifecycle boundary. Keep behavior, failure, timing, ownership, and safe-use facts; link rationale ([dsh-prose-standard](.agents/skills/dsh-prose-standard/SKILL.md)); wire mechanically checkable invariants into an executed top-level gate and prove each changed acceptance path rejects an invalid case.

Docs accompany every code change: update affected README and JSDoc contracts together. Routine bilingual work follows [docs/AGENTS.md](docs/AGENTS.md); only explicit user invocation may run `dsh-translate-docs`. Paragraph, fact-home, and word-budget rules live there.

## Editing these instructions

`CLAUDE.md` symlinks `AGENTS.md` at root and `packages/`; edit the real file. Keep rules self-contained while linking high-level docs; condense when clarity survives before raising a `verify-doc-budgets` ceiling.

## Vendoring policy

`vendor/` packages are pinned source copies (manifest with upstream SHAs in [vendor/README.md](vendor/README.md)). Update via the sync procedure there, re-apply or retire logged local modifications, and rerun `pnpm run test && pnpm run build`.

## ~/.dsh config backup

Machine-local dsh profiles, settings, and presets are versioned in the private repo `wxj-1019/dsh-config` ([dsh-config backup note](.agents/notes/implemented/process/2026-09-08-dsh-config-backup-repo.md)).
